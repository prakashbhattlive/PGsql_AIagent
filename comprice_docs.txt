📌 Purpose
This document describes a cleaned, merged dataset of computer specifications and prices. It is designed for tabular regression tasks where the goal is to predict the price of a PC or laptop based on its hardware and configuration.
📊 Dataset Overview
- Size: ~100,000 rows
- Type: Tabular, structured
- Target column: price
- Use case: Regression modeling, feature engineering, benchmarking
🧠 Modeling Objectives
LLMs or ML models using this dataset should be able to:
- Engineer features from categorical and numeric data
- Handle high-cardinality variables (e.g., brands, models)
- Build robust regression models (e.g., tree-based, boosting, deep learning)
- Efficiently manage large-scale tabular data

🧭 Instructional Use
When users provide instructions (e.g., “Find all laptops with OLED displays and RTX GPUs under $1500”), this context allows the LLM to:
- Understand the schema and column meanings
- Parse constraints and filters correctly
- Generate SQL queries, summaries, or recommendations
- Respond with accurate, context-aware answers
